          ## External DNS

          This guide will walk you through configuring [External DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns) for your Kubernetes cluster.

          It is roughly equivalent to following the [Installing with Helm](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/external-dns) guide, but includes opportunities to add [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io) patches on top of the rendered helm chart before depoying.

          Tiller is not required for this installation, all Helm templating is done client-side.
    - render:
        root: .
    - helmIntro: {}
    - helmValues:
        path: chart/values.yaml
    - render:
        root: .
        assets:
          v1:
            - helm:
                dest: base/
                helm_opts:
                  - --name=external-dns
                local:
                  chart_root: ./chart
                values_from:
                  # hack, helmValues still needs a configurable dest path for us to store the output
                  path: .ship/tmp
    - kustomizeIntro: {}
    - kustomize:
        base: base
        overlay: overlays/ship
        dest: external-dns-all.yaml
    - message:
        contents: |
          ## All set

          You can deploy external-dns to your cluster with

              kubectl apply -f external-dns-all.yaml

          Next, you can verify the installation by running through one of the [tutorials](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns/tree/master/docs/tutorials) for your preferred DNS provider.
